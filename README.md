# web3-engineer-cookbook

Opinionated, copy-pasteable building blocks for fintech/insurtech on chain. Find minimal, well-documented patterns for wallet auth and signature verification, safe contract interaction from backend services, event listening/indexing, and off-chain storage handshakes (IPFS/S3) — plus reference flows relevant to KYC, claims, payouts, and policy lifecycle events. Designed to help engineers move from “hello world” to production-grade components that are auditable and easy to extend. Great for founders/teams who need reliable scaffolds without wading through bloated boilerplates.
